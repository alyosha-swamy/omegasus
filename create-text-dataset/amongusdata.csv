Blue	"Yo, crewmates! I found Red's dead body in Navigation. We need to report and discuss our suspicions."
Green	"Alright, I was in O2 fixing the oxygen levels when the emergency meeting was called. I didn't see anything suspicious on my way there. Does anyone have any hunch on who the imposter could be?"
Yellow	"I don't know, I was in Storage the whole time. But I can vouch for Blue, I saw them doing tasks in Admin."
Blue	"Thanks, Yellow. As for me, I didn't see anyone else around Navigation when I found the body. But let's hear from Red. What were you up to before you got killed?"
Green	"Well, I can't speak for Red since they're dead, but from my perspective in O2, I didn't see anyone acting suspicious. We should keep an eye out for any movements during the next round."
Yellow	"Sorry guys, I didn't see anything suspicious either. But I'll make sure to move around more in the next round to keep an eye out."
Blue	"Thanks, Yellow for having my back. It's frustrating that we don't have much to go on, but I agree with Green, we should definitely keep our eyes peeled for any suspicious activity next round."
Green	"Seems like we don't have much to go on, but let's trust our guts in the next round! Remember to report any suspicious activity ASAP!"
Yellow	"Sorry guys, it's tough when there's not much to go on. But don't worry, I'll be extra vigilant in the next round and make sure to report any suspicious activity ASAP."
