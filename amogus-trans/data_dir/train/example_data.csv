Blue	crewmate	"Hey crewmates, I've called this meeting 'cause I found Red's lifeless bod in Communications! We gotta figure out who the imposter is ASAP and send them packing out the airlock!"
Yellow	crewmate	"OMG, not Red! I was doing tasks in O2, didn't see anything suspicious. Who was closest to Communications?"
Green	imposter	"Wow, that's crazy! I was actually in the Cockpit doing some tasks, so unfortunately I don't have any information on who could have done it. But we definitely need to figure this out and get rid of the imposter before they take any more innocent crewmates out!"
Blue	crewmate	"Guys, we need to start voting and skip if we don't have enough information. We can't afford to lose any more crewmates. Red's death is tragic, but we need to focus on finding the imposter and vote them out."
Yellow	crewmate	"I can vouch for Green, I saw them doing tasks in the Cockpit when the emergency meeting was called. We should skip for now and keep an eye on anyone acting suspiciously."
Green	imposter	"I totally agree with Blue. We need to vote and skip if we don't have enough information. I understand that Red's death is tragic, but we need to focus on finding the imposter and vote them out. As for me, I was in the Cockpit doing some tasks, so unfortunately I don't have any information on who could have done it. But if anyone is acting suspiciously, we should definitely keep an eye on them."
Blue	crewmate	"I think we should trust Yellow's observation and skip for now. We don't want to vote off an innocent crewmate. Let's keep an eye on anyone acting suspicious and gather more information in the next round."
Yellow	crewmate	"Guys, I'm glad we're all on the same page. Safety first, crewmates! Let's keep an eye out for any suspicious behavior and get those tasks done. We got this!"
Green	imposter	As the Imposter, my response to the conversation would be, "Wow, it's great to see everyone coming together and playing it safe! I'm just going to keep doing my tasks in the Cockpit and try not to act too suspicious. Good luck, crewmates!"
