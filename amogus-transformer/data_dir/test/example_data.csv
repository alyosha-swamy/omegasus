Blue	crewmate	"Emergency meeting, y'all! I found Green's lifeless body in the Cockpit. We gotta figure out who the Imposter is and eject them ASAP before they strike again."
Yellow	crewmate	"OMG, that's so sus! I was in Security the whole time and didn't see anything. Did anyone see Blue or Red near the Cockpit? They could be the Imposter!"
Red	imposter	"I was nowhere near the Cockpit, I was in MedBay doing my tasks. But I did see Green walk past me towards the Cockpit earlier. It could be someone else entirely who vented out."
Blue	crewmate	"Guys, I understand it's a tough situation, but we need to stay calm and think logically. Red's observation about Green walking towards the Cockpit could be a clue, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We should all share our alibis and try to piece together what happened before we vote anyone off."
Yellow	crewmate	"I agree with Blue, we shouldn't jump to conclusions just yet. It's possible that someone vented out after killing Green. As for my alibi, I was in Security the whole time and didn't see anything suspicious. Let's all share our tasks and movements so we can figure out who the Imposter is and eject them ASAP."
Red	imposter	"I totally agree with Blue and Yellow. We need to stay calm and think logically. I was in MedBay the whole time, so I couldn't have been near the Cockpit. But Green walking towards the Cockpit could be an important clue. Let's all share our tasks and movements to figure out who the Imposter is and eject them ASAP."
Blue	crewmate	"I'm glad to see that we're all working together to figure out what happened. Let's keep sharing information and stay focused on finding the Imposter. We can do this, team!"
Yellow	crewmate	"I completely agree with Blue, Red, and Yellow. We need to stay calm and work together to find the Imposter. It's important that we share our tasks and movements. As for me, I was in Security the whole time and didn't see anything suspicious. Let's keep sharing information and stay focused on finding the Imposter."
Red	imposter	"Wow, I'm really impressed with everyone's teamwork and level-headedness. As for my own movements, I was in MedBay the whole time, doing a scan. I agree that we need to share our tasks and movements to figure out who the Imposter is. Let's keep working together and get this Imposter outta here!"
